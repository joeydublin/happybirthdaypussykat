      <p>As far as I can tell, the picture above is the first pic I ever took of you! It was taken the day we walked the Manly-Spit bridge walk. I sneakily took the picture without your permission so please accept my belated appology for being a creep!</p>

        <p> But that top pic isn't the picture that reminds me the most about you back in those days when we first met. The picture on the right is most like image I remember of you back then. You had the same hat on, same jacket, and you were standing under a tree (in the dark though).</p>
