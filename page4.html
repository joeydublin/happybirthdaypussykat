            After the wedding we embarked on probably the only major trip we've ever been on. Hopefully we'll get to do something similar again some time soon. 
            The man in the picture on the left offered me 2 donkeys for my wife. 2 donkeys!! I told him to get lost and that you were worth at last 4 donkeys.
