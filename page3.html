      <h1 style="text-align: center;">Meet the parents!</h1>
      <p>Looking back on 2011 things actually moved quiet fast, with us taking a trip back to Europe in September where we were introduced to each other's parents for the first time. This is the first pic I have of your dad from that trip, where we was telling me something about 'the family circle' or something like that. You can tell by his hand gesture that he was happy to see me!</p>

        <p>But that top pic isn't the picture that reminds me the most about you back in those days when we first met. The picture on the right is most like the image I remember of you back then. You had the same hat on, same jacket, and you were standing under a tree (in the dark though).</p>
        <p>Back then I knew nothing about you. All I knew was that you were in Australia, your friends were gone home, that you were a nurse and that you couldn't walk more than 10 meters without stopping to take a photograph!</p>

        <img src="/happybirthdaypussykat/images/salsa dancers.jpg" style="border:2px solid black;width:150px;float:left;margin:0 10px 0 10px;"/>  
        <p>As well as going on walks, we also got in to salsa dancing. I wan't able to find any actual pics of us doing this, but this is pretty much how we looked as far as I remember. Goddamn we were good!</p> 
        <p>I was devastated when you graduated into the more senior class than me and I had to play catchup!</p>
        <p>I have to admit those times were really fun, if a little weird! Can you believe that we used to spend 4-5 hours a week practicing Salsa dancing!! I'm glad we got to do this...</p>
