      <h1 style="text-align: center;">Meet the parents!</h1>
      <p>Looking back on 2011 things actually moved quiet fast, with us taking a trip back to Europe in September where we were introduced to each other's parents for the first time. This is the first pic I have of your dad from that trip (I think he was telling me something about the gun he had upstairs or something like that). You can tell by his hand gesture that he was happy to see me!</p>

        <p>We moved in together (properly) in November 2011. As you can see from the picture on the right my 'domestication' training started straight away ;).</p>
        <p>We both loved living in Coogee. Beach down the road, nice cafes, nice food etc. It was a great lifestyle, and we had so much time to ourselves. We definetely wasted so much time just taking it easy, and it was fantastic.</p>

            <p style="vertical-align:top">This picture was from our first Christmas eve together in 2011. I remember thinking to myself at the time what the next few Christmasses would bring. Little did I know that only a few years later we'd have a very different 24th-December! (roll the mouse over the picture on the left)</p>
