Happy birthday Pussykat.

We haven't really put much effort in to celebrating our birthdays over the years, and you know, I'm starting to think that it's time that we started. 

I love you. I have since I met you, and I still do just as much as in the early days; moreso even. You are my life, and your happiness is my happiness. I can't be happy unless you are. 

So anyway, I thought that since I can't be with you for your birthday I'd put together a little website to celebrate YOU :).
